**Height Checker**

Students are asked to stand in non-decreasing order of heights for an annual photo.

Return the minimum number of students that must move in order for all students to be standing in non-decreasing order of height.

Notice that when a group of students is selected they can reorder in any possible way between themselves and the non selected students remain on their seats.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
Current array : [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Target array  : [1,1,1,2,3,4]
On index 2 (0-based) we have 4 vs 1 so we have to move this student.
On index 4 (0-based) we have 1 vs 3 so we have to move this student.
On index 5 (0-based) we have 3 vs 4 so we have to move this student.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,4]
Output: 5
```

**Example 3:**

```java
Input: heights = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 0
```



这个是一个数组题，我一直觉得对他计算output的物理意义存疑，他的解法和我原始想法一样，就是复制数据进行对比，有什么不同那就是计入几个。

```java
class Solution {
    public int heightChecker(int[] heights) {
        int[] copy = heights.clone();
        Arrays.sort(copy);
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < copy.length; i++){
            if(heights[i]!=copy[i])count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
